# ðŸŽ¯ MNIST-CUDA  

A custom deep learning framework built from scratch using CUDA in C++. This project implements essential neural network components, including:  

âœ… Linear (fully connected) layers  
âœ… Convolutional layers  
âœ… ReLU activation function  
âœ… Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss  

The framework is designed to efficiently train and evaluate models on the MNIST dataset using CUDA for parallelized computations.

This is still a work in progress and could be updated in future realeases.
